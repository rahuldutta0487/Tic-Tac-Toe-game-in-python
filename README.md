# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python
Tic Tac Toe is a simple 2-player game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell with 'X' or 'O' to get 3 in a row, column, or diagonal. Python implementation involves a matrix to represent the board, functions to check win/draw and display the board, and a main loop to take turns and check results.
